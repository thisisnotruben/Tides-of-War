    For non-critters:
        race-ID
            or
        character_name-ID<*>
            or
        character_race-ID<#>
            or 
        character_name

    for critters:
        critter-critter_race-weapon-swing_type-ID
        (weapon and swing type don't do anything here)
        
                    
        -ID is irrelevant and never used in-game, just makes sure every character is named uniquely in the node tree
        -<*> is used to denote that this unit will have this "Character Name" that is used multiple times in game
        -<#> defines that this unit is a commoner (non-combative, doesn't have attack animations)
        -When just character name, it is a unique name only used once in the map defined
        *ALL ABOVE MUST BE DEFINED IN meta/unit_meta.json
