        Those damn basterd crabs took my wife from me! I'll never forgive them
        for what they've done to her and me. One of them swallowed my sword while
        fighting them off before they got to my beloved wife. I can't rest while
        they're out there walking and pinching there pincers. Avenge my wife and
        bring me tere pincers and I'll see to it you're rewarded well.
