        I'm tired of eating this mundane food everyday. Back home, I was
        the best cook in the village. Since coming here, I noticed we just rely
        on the food imported from the mainland. Being the entrepreneur I am, I bet
        I can make a name for myself just like back home. I've made a recipe in
        which I believe can knock off the trousers of the king. Gather these
        ingredients from the land and bring them back to me so I can get to cooking.
