        Our holy church is interested into these other inhabitants that were mentioned
        in the reports. Go seek out the tribe south of the scouting outpost, and
        tell me how they are like.

        Hmmm... You say they mentioned a mighty city named Khozgrogal. I've
        heard of this place... I heard it's the biggest orc city in the world
        that's unmatched in the strength of it's people. Huge monuments built
        from all their conquests. A force to be reckoned with for sure.

        Hello stranger, I haven't seen your kind before. My name is Nogugh, and I'm
        a shaman from our mighty city Khozgrogal in the west. I hope you didn't come
        to defile these lands, for we are the watchers of this heavenly paradise.
        What brings you to me?
