        We were ambushed last night by the gnolls north of us and
        they ran away with the report I was suppose to send to
        Chapman. We've tried retrieving the report, but we're
        unsuccesful... We last seem them tear it apart, I'm sure
        they still have the pages of the report. Recover the five
        pages from the gnolls so I can stitch them together and hand
        them to you.

        Have you gotten the pages yet?

        Agh yes, thank you plenty for saving my skin. Let me just
        stitch these up and add my stamp...Here you go!
