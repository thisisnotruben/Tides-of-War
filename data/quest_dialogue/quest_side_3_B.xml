        You say I stole a necklace, but then again I forget a lot
        of things. Well maybe if I got a boysenberry pie from
        Kassidy I can maybe remember. I'm sure if you bring her
        five boysenberries she can bake up a pie for me.

        I'm only getting hungrier by the minute, you're lucky
        that my stomach isn't big enough for two pies!

        Mhmm, this sure is delicious. You didn't bring me any
        milk? Oh well, I can do without. Just let me finish
        this first.

        That kid sure does love boysenberry pie, anything for that
        sweetheart. Here you go, give it to him while it's still fresh will ya.
