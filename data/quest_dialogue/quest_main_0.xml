        Finally you guys are here. We've been waiting for supplies from the mainland for a while now.
        We're spread thin around here and sure can use your help. We can have you sent out to go
        lumber wood, but well honestly you're talents would be wasted. Report to Chapman who is down
        by the barracks, he'll be able to assign you to your duties.
