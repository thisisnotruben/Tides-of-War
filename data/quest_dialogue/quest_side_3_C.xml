        It's all coming back to me! I remember skipping through the woods
        by "__(MAP_ZONE)__", and I dropped, or should I say saw a necklace
        exactly like the one you're talking about on the ground, and this huge
        gnoll picked it up and ran back to his camp. I'm sure if you ask for it
        back they'll give it back.

        Fantastic pie, but as I told you, the big scary gnoll took it. Get it and
        take it to that old lady.

        My family necklace! I never thought I'd see it again, thank
        you so much dear. Here, take this. This was my husband's lucky
        sword, if only he took with him on his last campaign!

        I'm forever grateful.
