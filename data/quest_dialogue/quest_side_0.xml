        The "__(ARMY NAME)__" has placed a bounty on "__(UNIT NAME)__" for acts of raiding. Slaughter them and
        bring me their paws, and the "__(ARMY NAME)__" will reward you well.

        You have the paws? Great! Captain "__(UNIT NAME)__" was worried about the gnoll
        situation, and I'll like to tell him that we got it under control thanks to your efforts.

        The gnoll situation has calmed down ever since you took care of them. That'll teach them
        to leave us alone now.
