        We have placed a bounty on Bruiseclaw and his pack of gnolls for acts of raiding.
        Slaughter them and bring me their paws, and the expedition here will reward you well.

        You have the paws? Great! Chapman was worried about the gnoll
        situation, and I'll like to tell him that we got it under control thanks to your efforts.

        The gnoll situation has calmed down ever since you took care of them. That'll teach them
        to leave us alone now.
