        I got a real predicament on my hands. I got a contract I got to fulfill,
        but I'm running out of time to complete the order. The forest has scared
        my workers away and thus, left all their lumber out. I need you to go out
        there and collect the wood left out, and then just maybe I can meet my deadline.

        Hurry! If I don't get this order in, no one would want to contract me again.

        Excellent! I should be able to fulfill my order on time. To show my gratitude, here's
        something for your troubles.

        Business is good thanks to you.
