        There are strong forces in these lands. Forces that I cannot describe.
        I've recieved reports of a temple in the lands west of us. I believe
        these forces are emanating from that temple. I want you to travel there
        and bring me back whatever it is that's calling us.

        There are forces at play here beyond our understanding. I need to know
        what's in that temple.
