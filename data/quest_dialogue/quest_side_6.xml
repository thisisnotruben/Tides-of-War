        Greetings, the savage beasts of the land have been growing more aggressive
        as of lately the more we venture out from here. Our laborers out there cannot
        work with these consant attacks froms them. We could use your help out there.

        Thanks for the help. There must be something in the land to make these vile
        beasts so bold. Whatever it can be, I hope it doesn't spread any further.
