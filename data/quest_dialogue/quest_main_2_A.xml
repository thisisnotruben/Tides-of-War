        Now since we're now more in working order, we can finally move on to more
        important matters. We have a small scouting outpost to the west of the lake
        where most of our reports come from. However, they haven't sent their usual
        report to us, and I'm concerned on what's going on. Go check up on them.
        Waltkins, is in charge there, go speak to him and see what's going on.

        We need that report from Waltkins. He's west of the lake.

       It seems we're not alone in these lands. Thanks for delivering these reports.
