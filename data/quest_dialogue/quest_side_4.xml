        Listen, I really shouldn't be telling you this, but I'm kind
        of a big deal. Too big in fact that I had to move down here
        from the mainland. Now, they might tell you otherwise on why
        I moved down here but that doesn't matter. I owe Marlo
        a favor or two. Now, can you take this package down to the camp
        up north and deliver it to Marlo".

        what happened to those men, don't mention me.
